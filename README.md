# Auri (.aur)

**Auri** is a programming language designed specifically for the **Pixel Virtual Machine (PVM)**. Using the `.aur` file extension, Auri combines the **power of low-level programming** with the **clarity and usability of high-level syntax**.  

With Auri, you can write programs that provide **full control over memory, logic, and execution flow**, while keeping the code readable and easy to maintain.

## Key Features

- **Low-Level Control with High-Level Syntax**  
  Write programs close to the hardware without the complexity usually associated with low-level languages.

- **Precise Memory and Resource Management**  
  Access offsets directly, read and write memory, and control virtual memory allocation.

- **Advanced Debugging and Monitoring**  
  Use `breakpoint` and `watchpoint` features to trace your program's behavior step by step.

- **Interactive Input/Output**  
  Capture keyboard input, print values, and execute code interactively.

- **Support for Complex Data and Computations**  
  Work with numbers, strings, conditional logic, and mathematical operations—all with simple, clear syntax.

## Example: Hello World

Here’s a simple Hello World program in Auri:

```aur
write("Hello, World!")
```
